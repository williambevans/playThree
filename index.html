    <h1>Uncommon Sense</h1>
    <h2>By William H. Bevans Jr.</h2>
    
    <p class="dropcap">There comes a time when the people of a land must confront the truth, no matter how uncomfortable, no matter how deeply entrenched the rot may be. This is that time. The fabric of our counties, the institutions that claim to serve us, have betrayed their fundamental purpose. The government that taxes us, that extracts from us the fruits of our labor, has abandoned its duty to represent, protect, and serve the people. Instead, they serve only themselves, their cronies, and the industries that quietly hollow out our land while feeding us lies.</p>

    <h3>On the Nature of Government and Its Failure</h3>
    <p>Government, at its core, should exist to ensure order, equity, and representation. It should be a structure that, when functioning correctly, provides stability and accountability. But in Bosque County and beyond, the institutions that govern us have abandoned these principles...</p>

    <h3>On the Absence of Representation</h3>
    <p>What use is taxation without representation? We fund the machine that grinds us into the dirt. They take from us, not just in dollars, but in the quality of our air, our water, and our land. And in return, what do we receive? A judge’s office that selectively applies the law? A district attorney that pursues prosecutions based on politics rather than justice? A regulatory body like the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that rubber-stamps pollution permits for corporations while turning a blind eye to the damage done to our rivers and communities?</p>

    <h3>On the Industrial Exploitation of Our Land</h3>
    <p>They bring in solar farms with grand promises of economic growth, yet where are the returns? The soil is scorched, the water tables altered, and when the subsidies dry up, the panels are left to rot—no accountability, no restoration...</p>

    <h3>On the Corruption of Law and Order</h3>
    <p>Justice, in theory, should serve as the great equalizer. Yet here, it is wielded as a weapon against the very people it should protect. Selective prosecution, intimidation tactics, and favoritism run rampant...</p>

    <h3>On the Necessity of Action</h3>
    <p>It is not enough to see the problem. It is not enough to complain. We must act. We must reclaim what is ours—not just our land and resources, but the integrity of our institutions...</p>

    <h3>A Final Call</h3>
    <p>This is a fight for more than just our land or our tax dollars. It is a fight for our sovereignty, for our right to self-govern, for the future of our communities. If we do nothing, we accept their rule. But if we stand, if we make our voices heard, then they cannot ignore us.</p>
